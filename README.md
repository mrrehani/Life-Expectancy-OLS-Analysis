## Description
In this project, I focused on using machine learning to predict life expectancy based on a wide range of factors. To achieve this, I used a multiple linear regression method and combined this with interactive graphs and displays to demonstrate how variables like education and average GDP link to life expectancy across continents. I ensured that all data I used fit key assumptions for the regression analysis and worked to correct for factors like heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity, etc. that can potentially disrupt my end results.

### Technologies Used:
- Statsmodels (Ordinary Least Squares Regression)

- Matplotlib
- Plotly

### Instructions
- Clone the repository
- Open the notebook file, making sure that the 'Life Expectancy Data.csv' file is still in the same directory
- Run the all the cells
